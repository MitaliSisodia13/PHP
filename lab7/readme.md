# Lab 7 - Application Logging with Composer and Monolog

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of application logging in a PHP application using Composer and Monolog. Logging is an essential part of web applications as it helps in monitoring application behavior, debugging issues, and enhancing security. This project configures multiple logging channels using Monolog and follows PSR-4 standards for structured code organization.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of logging in web applications.
- Use Composer to install and configure Monolog.
- Set up multiple logging channels for different log levels (e.g., info, error).
- Implement PSR-4 autoloading for efficient code management.
- Demonstrate logging of various events and errors to specific log channels.
